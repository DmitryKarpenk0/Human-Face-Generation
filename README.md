# Human Face Generation

The task was to train a generative-adversarial model to generate people's faces. 

Here are two notebooks: the first one was trained on a small dataset (around 3.000 images), and the second one was trained on a much larger one (around 70.000 images). Spoiler, the result is much better on the larger dataset :).

Dataset for the first part: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sadstatue/part-of-flickr-faces <br />
Dataset for the second part: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/melikbekyanashot/faces-dataset

The files are quite large and don't show up on github, so I'm attaching links to colab:
